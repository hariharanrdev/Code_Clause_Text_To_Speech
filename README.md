# Text-to-Speech (TTS) with GUI

## Overview
This project provides a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Python. The application allows users to input text and hear it spoken aloud.

## Features
- Input text through a graphical interface.
- Convert text to speech using a TTS engine.
- Play, pause, and stop speech.
- Save speech to an audio file.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` for GUI
- `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech conversion

## Installation

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The GUI will open. Enter the text you want to convert to speech in the input field.

3. Click the "Speak" button to hear the text spoken aloud.

4. You can also pause, resume, or stop the speech using the respective buttons.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the application.
- `gui.py`: Contains the GUI code.
- `tts.py`: Contains the text-to-speech conversion logic.
